# Solar Plane V5

# Introduction:
The SPV5 project is a radio-controlled solar powered plane created by me in my spare time over the course of 6 months. 

It features Sunpower C60 solar cells, a Genasun MPPT charge controller, a high efficiency low KV motor and a largely 3D printed structure.

At the end of the project the plane was test flown, but crashed almost immediately after launch. Despite this, it features some interesting engineering.

# Parts worthy of discussion:

## Fuselage:

The fuselage "shell" contains the most important electrical components:

1. Battery
2. MPPT Charge controller
3. Charge controller "manager" board
4. ESC (not modelled)
5. Reciever (not modelled)
6. Wiring (not modelled)

These are mounted on a carbon fiber rail system using neodymium magnets (to ensure easy servicing). The rails are securely attached to the main structural beam which connects the fuselage, wings and tail together. 

## Electronics:

## Planform / aero:

## 3D printed elements


## Structural elements

Because the fuselage shell, wings and tail have very little structural integrity of their own, the plane is held together using pultruded carbon fibre tubes. At intersection points, 3D prints hold the rods together.
